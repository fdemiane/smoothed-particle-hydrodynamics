# Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

An efficient implementation of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm for fluids simulation.
The algorithm uses an non-symmetrical octree for neighborhood search.
The program outputs the results in "Output.txt".\\
To visualize, please use the renderer in the Parallel-SPH repo.
