# Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

An efficient implementation of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm for fluids simulation.
The algorithm uses an non-symmetrical octree for neighborhood search.
The program outputs the results in "Output.txt".
To visualize, please use the DirectX renderer I wrote in the Parallel-SPH repository (https://github.com/freddy998/Parallel-SPH).
